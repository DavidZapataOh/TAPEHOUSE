# @tapehouse/sdk

Typed reads and transactions for [Tapehouse](https://github.com/DavidZapataOh/TAPEHOUSE)'s price band, its feeds, the margin accounts, the supply vault, the gap backstop, the baskets, the short positions, the Morpho oracles and the gap cover, on [viem](https://viem.sh).

```bash
pnpm add @tapehouse/sdk viem
```

Every call takes a chain's registry, `deployments/<chainId>.json` from the Tapehouse repository, parsed with `parseDeployments`: the SDK compiles in no address. Reads take a viem client. Transactions come back as viem contract calls, ready for `simulateContract` and `writeContract`.

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'
import { createWalletClient, http, publicActions } from 'viem'
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
import { band, parseDeployments, shorts } from '@tapehouse/sdk'

const deployments = parseDeployments(JSON.parse(readFileSync('deployments/4663.json', 'utf8')))
const client = createWalletClient({ account: privateKeyToAccount(key), transport: http(rpc) }).extend(publicActions)
const account = client.account.address

const { state, low, high } = await band.quote(client, deployments, 'NVDA')
const sale = await shorts.quoteSale(client, deployments, { asset: 'NVDA', amount: 10n ** 18n, slippageBps: 50n })
const { request } = await client.simulateContract({
  ...shorts.sell(deployments, { asset: 'NVDA', amount: 10n ** 18n, minProceeds: sale.minProceeds, account }),
  account: client.account,
})
await client.writeContract(request)
```

- `band`: the band's `quote`, `session`, `halt` and stored `price`; each asset's `BandFeed` (`latestRound`, `latestBand`, `sealed`, `seal`); `chainlinkRound` of a `.chainlink` feed; and `writePrices` with the signed RedStone packages a `PackageSource` of your own supplies. The SDK holds no API key.
- `accounts`: `setAuthorization`, `deposit`, `depositWithPermit`, `wrap` (ether into WETH for an account), `withdraw`, `borrow`, `repay`, `unwrap`, `lend`, `unlend`, `recall`, `settle`, `isAuthorized`, `health`, `collateral`, `leverage`, `liquidationPrice`, `repayment`, the debt and premium a full repayment takes, `inBaskets`, what a position holds of each Stock Token through its baskets, `stocks` and `positions`, an account's possible positions, `lending`, what a position lent, may sell, recalled and waits for, `holding`, an asset's holding against its cap and the tokens the accounts hold, `limits`, the debt, the caps, the weekend leverage, the guardian's pause and the premium rate, and `issuer`, a Stock Token's pause and its registry's blocks; every group read at one block. A basket's address deposits and withdraws its shares, in the cross position alone.
- `engine`: the margin engine's `requirement` and `currentRequirement` of any portfolio, over two days by default.
- `supply`: the supply vault's `deposit`, `depositWithPermit` with a USDG permit, `withdraw` and `redeem`; `market`, its rates, utilisation, what it holds and lent and whether it takes deposits; and `lender`, a lender's shares, what they are worth and what may leave now.
- `backstop`: the gap backstop's `deposit`, `startCooldown`, `withdraw`, `redeem`, `claimGains` and `claim`, the premium for the shares; `state`, each exposure limit of the current closure with a pending change, what is left and covered, the premium rate, the reserve's share and the premium waiting, the cooldown terms and the owner's seed; and `depositor`, a depositor's shares, cooldown window and gains per Stock Token.
- `stockLending`: a lending vault's recall `ticket`, what it holds for it and the ticket next in turn, and its `terms`: utilisation, rates, what it holds for recalls, what may still be borrowed, `MAX_UTILIZATION`, `NOTICE` and the owner's fee share.
- `sponsorship`: the EntryPoint, the SimpleAccountFactory and the sponsor paymaster of `.erc4337` and `.tapehouse`, `freeOperationsLeft`, `asCall`, the EIP-2612 `permit` an owner signs for its smart account, and `pull`, the permit and transfer by which the account takes the token.
- `baskets`: `mint` and `redeem` of a basket of `.tapehouse.Baskets`, in kind, and the views `components`, `previewMint`, `previewRedeem`, `target` and `pendingTarget`.
- `shorts`: `deposit`, `withdraw`, `sell`, `cover`, `liquidate`, `mark`, the views `position`, `health`, `epoch`, `book`, `restriction` and `fee`, and `quoteSale` and `quoteCover`, the limits of a sale and a buy-back from Uniswap's QuoterV2, with a slippage of 0 to 10,000 basis points.
- `morpho`: an asset's Morpho oracle from `.morphoOracles`, its `price`, which is no price, never zero, where it reverts with `NoAnswer` or `SequencerNotSettled`, and says why (`stale`, `halted` or `sequencerNotSettled`), its `halt`, and the `oracle` itself: band, symbol, tokens, scale and owner.
- `gapCover`: `buy`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `redeem`, `record`, `measure`, `observe`, `settle`, `release`, `claim`, `quote` with the writers' USDG a cover reserves, `pricingGap`, the weekend gap it prices at, which follows the week before the close, `minDeductible`, `capacity`, `lastCloseMs`, `sales`, `series` (open, settled with its reference and reopening prices, or void), `cover`, `payouts`, `payout`, what a settled cover pays, `writers`, the writers' USDG, what covers reserve and wait on, and `writer`, a writer's shares.
- `decodeRevert`: the name and arguments of any revert of the contracts, the baskets, the gap cover, the band, the Stock Tokens, USDG, or Solidity's `Error(string)` and `Panic`.
- `tokenPriceFeed` and `sharePriceFeed`: a `.chainlink` feed typed by what it prices, the Stock Token on Robinhood Chain and the share on Arbitrum One.
- The contracts' ABIs, `as const`, generated from the Solidity build.

`examples/devnode.ts` runs all of it against a local Nitro dev node; it reads the account owner's key from `PRIVATE_KEY` in its environment, never from its command line.
