## The Problem

Stock Tokens trade around the clock, but the prices that lend against them do not.

- Chainlink's equity feeds on Robinhood Chain go dark at the weekend, and their heartbeat is suspended with them.
- The weekend is still a full trading period: about 30% of SPY's Stock Token transfers on the chain happen then.
- Lending protocols answer by pricing every asset on its own, at its last close, with conservative loan-to-value ratios. A portfolio of five assets is treated as five separate risks.

| | Today | Tapehouse |
|---|---|---|
| Weekend price | Last close, or a pause | A deterministic band from several sources, valid all week |
| Margin | One asset at a time | One requirement for the whole portfolio, with correlations |
| Gap loss | Socialised after the fact | Priced in, then absorbed by a declared backstop with a stated limit |
| Liquidation | Bots racing at the reopening | A sealed-bid auction by lots when the market reopens |
| Collateral | Idle | Earns a lending fee while it backs the loan |

1. **The band**, a Stylus program, turns the sources into a price, a width and a regime for each asset, including the 24/5 session and trading halts.
2. **The margin engine**, a Stylus program, walks a lattice of price scenarios for the whole portfolio, with pairwise correlations, the asset's weekend gap and the depth of its pool, and returns one requirement.
3. **Margin accounts** hold the positions, the **supply vault** lends USDG against them, and **stock lending** pays the collateral's owner a fee.
4. When an account falls short, the **liquidator** sells it; at a reopening it goes to a **sealed-bid auction by lots**.
5. A shortfall beyond the collateral falls to the **gap backstop**, whose exposure is capped per position.
6. **Keepers** push prices and halts, the **indexer and API** serve history, and **smart accounts** pay the gas of a user's first operations.

## Live Demo

**<https://app.tapehouse.xyz>**, on Robinhood Chain testnet (46630).

| Page | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `/` Account | Live bands for every asset, deposit, borrow and repay, and the liquidation price before anything is signed |
| `/earn` | The supply vault, the gap backstop and the other places to put USDG to work |
| `/risk` | The backstop's exposure against its limit, the reopening auction, and each band's TWAP and premium |
| `/simulator` | What a position needs to survive a move |

Test USDG comes from [Paxos' faucet](https://faucet.paxos.com/?network=robinhood), linked from the app's header. A smart account pays no gas for its creation and its first three operations.

## Judge Walkthrough

| Claim | Where to verify it |
|---|---|
| Stylus is justified | [The table below](#stylus-versus-solidity): the margin program against a bit-exact Solidity reference, on the same dev-node calls |
| The band and the engine are deterministic | Fixed vectors, and a Solidity reference that agrees to the bit: `make test-stylus` |
| The deployed programs are the code in this repository | [Verification](#verification): rebuild a deployment and compare it byte for byte |
| It runs on a public network | The [live app](https://app.tapehouse.xyz) and the [addresses below](#deployed-contracts) |
| Every claim is tested | The CI badge above, and `make test` |
| It can be integrated | [SDKs](#services-and-sdks) in TypeScript, Rust and Go, and an MCP server for agents |

---

## Stylus versus Solidity

`contracts/test/reference/MarginReference.sol` is the margin engine in Solidity: the same scenario set, requirement, session and weekend cap. It answers every view of the Stylus program to the bit. The dev-node suite measures both on the same calls, in L2 gas. `make devnode deploy-stylus-devnode test-stylus-devnode gas-table` prints the run's table; this one is from `stylus/.gas-devnode`, and `make gas` fails if they differ:

| Call | Stylus | Solidity | Solidity / Stylus |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scenario(0)` | 118,013 | 232,187 | 2.0× |
| `scenarioDigest(32)` | 128,910 | 561,633 | 4.4× |
| `scenarioDigest(64)` | 139,628 | 933,948 | 6.7× |
| `scenarioDigest(128)` | 163,408 | 1,678,505 | 10.3× |
| `scenarioDigest(256)` | 209,547 | 3,167,787 | 15.1× |
| `scenarioDigest(256,launch)` | 317,868 | 6,502,649 | 20.5× |
| `requirement(3)` | 287,025 | 3,758,425 | 13.1× |
| `requirement(6)` | 428,836 | 7,174,691 | 16.7× |
| `currentRequirement(3)` | 351,236 | 3,820,422 | 10.9× |
| `currentRequirement(1 of 6)` | 453,061 | 7,189,769 | 15.9× |
| `assets()` | 94,636 | 42,216 | 0.4× |
| `volatility(NVDA)` | 99,212 | 46,665 | 0.5× |
| `correlation(NVDA,SPY)` | 106,019 | 54,471 | 0.5× |

- **Stylus wins wherever the scenario set is walked**: 13.1× cheaper for the requirement of three assets and 16.7× for six, and up to 20.5× for the six launch assets' full set.
- **Stylus loses the small views**, at about twice the gas: entering an uncached program costs about 95,000, more than reading a few words. Net of that entry cost the three-asset requirement is about 20× cheaper.
- The method, the compiler settings and the cost of a real pool read are in the [reference](docs/REFERENCE.md#stylus-versus-solidity).

`deployments/<chainId>.json` lists every contract the repository uses on each chain, and fork tests check each entry against the chain.

### What is not live yet

Stock lending, short positions, index baskets and gap cover are built and tested on the dev node, but they are not deployed on the testnet, so the app does not offer them. Restricted-jurisdiction and sanctions screening are not implemented. The mainnet deployment follows the testnet's.

---

## Verification

Every deployed Stylus program can be rebuilt from this repository and compared byte for byte with the code on chain, fragment by fragment. `make deploy-stylus` and `make verify-stylus` run `cargo-stylus` in the Docker image that `cargo stylus deploy` and `cargo stylus verify` use for reproducible builds (`offchainlabs/cargo-stylus-base` plus the toolchain in `stylus/rust-toolchain.toml`, linux/amd64), on the staged content of `stylus/`, so untracked files and unstaged edits never enter the build.

To verify a deployment yourself you need only Docker, make and git:

```bash
git checkout <commit>
make verify-stylus CHAIN=<chainId> TX=<deployment tx>
```

It passes only when `cargo-stylus` prints `Verification successful`. Both targets run `cargo-stylus` in the program's own directory, `stylus/contracts/<program>`: in a workspace with more than one program, `cargo stylus verify` finds the constructor there and nowhere else. Running `cargo stylus verify` directly also works, from that directory, but it exits 0 even when verification fails: read its last line. The *Stylus verification* workflow runs the same check on GitHub for any commit and deployment.

Verification covers the program's code. The configuration it was constructed with is checked by `stylus/scripts/check-band.sh` and `stylus/scripts/check-margin.sh`, which only read the chain.

Each deployment below verifies from the commit that added its row: `git log --reverse --format=%H -S <address> -- README.md | head -n 1`.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidZapataOh/TAPEHOUSE.git tapehouse
cd tapehouse
make build
make test
```

`make build` initialises the submodules and installs JavaScript dependencies on first run, and stops with a message if Node, Foundry or cargo-stylus does not match the pinned versions. The requirements, every `make` target and each component's commands are in the [reference](docs/REFERENCE.md).

```bash
make devnode                   # a local Nitro node, ArbOS 61
make deploy-contracts-devnode  # the contracts and programs, on it
make test-app-devnode          # the app, driven in Chromium against that deployment
```
