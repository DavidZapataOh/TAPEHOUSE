# Tapehouse

[![CI](https://github.com/DavidZapataOh/TAPEHOUSE/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DavidZapataOh/TAPEHOUSE/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Portfolio margin for Stock Tokens on Robinhood Chain.

## Repository layout

- `apps/landing` — the website at tapehouse.xyz (Next.js)
- `contracts` — Solidity contracts (Foundry)
- `stylus` — Stylus programs (Rust), starting with `band`, the price band
- `deployments` — contract addresses per chain, one JSON file per chain ID

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 24.x | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or `nvm install` (reads `.nvmrc`) |
| pnpm | 12.5.1, from `packageManager` | `corepack enable pnpm` |
| Foundry | 1.8.3 | `foundryup --install v1.8.3` |
| Slither | 0.11.6 | `pipx install --force slither-analyzer==0.11.6` |
| Rust | 1.91.0, from `stylus/rust-toolchain.toml` | [rustup](https://rustup.rs) installs it on first use |
| cargo-stylus | 0.10.9 | `cargo install --locked --force cargo-stylus@0.10.9` |
| Docker | any recent | [docker.com](https://www.docker.com) — only for `make devnode` |
| Python 3 and jq | any recent | preinstalled on macOS — only for the dev-node suite |
| GNU Make | 3.81 or newer | preinstalled on macOS and most Linux distributions |

## Build and test

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidZapataOh/TAPEHOUSE.git tapehouse
cd tapehouse
make build
make test
```

`make build` initialises git submodules and installs JavaScript dependencies on first run. It stops with a message if Node, Foundry or cargo-stylus does not match the versions above.

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Builds every component |
| `make test` | Runs every test suite |
| `make lint` | Formatting, lint and static analysis |
| `make coverage` | Solidity coverage, failing below 95% of lines or branches |
| `make gas` | Contract sizes, gas snapshots and WASM sizes, failing on any change |
| `make snapshot` | Regenerates the gas snapshots and `stylus/.wasm-size`; commit the result |
| `make build-contracts` · `test-contracts` · `lint-contracts` · `coverage-contracts` · `gas-contracts` · `snapshot-contracts` | Contracts only |
| `make build-stylus` · `test-stylus` · `lint-stylus` · `gas-stylus` · `snapshot-stylus` | Stylus programs only |
| `make check-activation` | `cargo stylus check` of every program against Robinhood Chain, its testnet and Arbitrum One |
| `make build-apps` · `test-apps` · `lint-apps` | Apps only |
| `make devnode deploy-stylus-devnode test-stylus-devnode` | Deploys `band` to a local dev node and writes live RedStone prices through it |

## Networks

| Network | Chain ID | Foundry alias | RPC variable | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Robinhood Chain | 4663 | `robinhood` | `ROBINHOOD_RPC_URL` | `https://robinhood.drpc.org` |
| Robinhood Chain testnet | 46630 | `robinhood-testnet` | `ROBINHOOD_TESTNET_RPC_URL` | `https://robinhood-testnet.drpc.org` |
| Arbitrum One | 42161 | `arbitrum` | `ARBITRUM_RPC_URL` | `https://arbitrum.gateway.tenderly.co` |
| Local dev node | 412346 | `devnode` | — | `http://127.0.0.1:8547` |

The defaults are public archive endpoints and need no key. Set a variable to use your own endpoint. The Makefile exports the defaults, so run fork tests through `make`. To call `forge` or `cast` directly, export the variables first. `make devnode` starts a local Nitro node on ArbOS 61, the same version as Robinhood Chain and Arbitrum One, and `make devnode-stop` removes it.

## Addresses

`deployments/<chainId>.json` lists every contract this repository uses on that chain. Fork tests check each entry against the chain at a pinned block.

## Deployer keys

No key is stored in this repository. Deployments sign with an encrypted Foundry keystore:

```bash
cast wallet import tapehouse-deployer --interactive
```

`forge` uses it with `--account tapehouse-deployer`. `cargo stylus` uses it with `--keystore-path ~/.foundry/keystores/tapehouse-deployer --keystore-password-path <file>`.

## The band program

`stylus/contracts/band` verifies signed RedStone data packages on-chain with the same rules as `PrimaryProdDataServiceConsumerBase` in `@redstone-finance/evm-connector` 1.0.0: five authorised signers, three unique signers per feed, the median of their values, and a package at most 180 s old and 60 s ahead. Verification errors keep the reference contract's names and selectors.

- `writePrices(bytes32[] feedIds, bytes payload)` verifies the payload and stores each value. Anyone may call it; a package no newer than the stored one reverts with `PackageNotNewer`.
- `price(bytes32 feedId)` returns the value, its package timestamp in milliseconds and the block timestamp it was written at, and never reverts.

`stylus/scripts/redstone-payload.py` builds a payload from the latest packages, for example `python3 stylus/scripts/redstone-payload.py NVDA---24_7`. It reads the public gateways, or the main gateway when `REDSTONE_API_KEY` is set.
